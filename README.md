#Casual MVVM

Casual MVVM is a library intended to be used for WPF applications and provides a simple framework
for implementing MVVM for every day development.

The focus is around simple, quick implementation development side, rather than correctness, and this
is not a complete MVVM framework.  It's here as a distillation of what is most commonly used in the
typical data driven, SQL backend, client/server type application.

In particular it has support for easily opening new windows from the ViewModel layer, without breaching
MVVM or compromising unit testability.
